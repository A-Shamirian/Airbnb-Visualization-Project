# Airbnb Visualization Project

## Dataset retrieved from Inside Airbnb Project (London, UK, retrieved September 2023): http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/

## Description:
As the popularity of Airbnb increases and a variety of short-term and long-term rental options become available, the need to improve customer and investor decision-making is relevant. This project uses Airbnb data from London, England to uncover trends to highlight information that will be useful for investors and customers. We analyze factors affecting Airbnb demand and pricing, and we also generate visualizations which reveal the tourist hotspots in London.
